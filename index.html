    <h1>My Web Design Journey</h1>
    <!-- Comments don't appear on web pages and help document changes, author, etc.-->
    <p>In this class I hope to learn more about HTML basics and a better understanding of how they work on a website. 
       I thought this class would fit right into what I do on a daily basis when it comes to doing marketing for clients.
       I am <em> very excited </em> to be able to at least feel more confident around HTML after this class versus right now knowing very little about HTML. 
       I also always found HTML very interesting on how all the html code put together can create such a stunning website and so on. about </p>
