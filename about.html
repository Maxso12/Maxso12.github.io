    <p>Hello my name is Maximillian Orosz and my major here at ACC is Business Administration which I have completed and my other certificate in Marketing. 
      I am currently going for the certificate in Web Designer which would overall complete my experience here at ACC. 
      When I'm not handling my school work I am mostly working on my business that I currently run and handling my clients. 
      I have always found an interest in the marketing/business field since I was younger and with some real world experience I pursued it as a full time career with school at the same time. </p>
