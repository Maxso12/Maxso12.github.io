    <p class="my-bio"> Hello, my name is Maximillian Orosz and I have recently completed my Associates Degree in Business Administration as well as a certification in Marketing. I am currently attending ACC for the Web Design Certificate. This certification will overall complete my experience here at ACC. 
      When I'm not handling my schoolwork, I am mostly working on my business and handling clients. I have always found an interest in the marketing/business field since I was much younger. After gaining some real-world experience, I decided to pursue it as a full-time career with school at the same time. </p>
